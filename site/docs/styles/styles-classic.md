A minimalist Docusaurus design that embraces soft, subtle details while
remaining superbly functional and readable.

## Try It Out

You can also open the DevTools Console panel in
[device mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/) to play
with these fluid custom properties.

<Demo/>

### Common Use Cases

Use this when you want a neutral, minimalist stylesheet for your site.

## Installation

:::tip
If you use the preset `@docupotamus/docusaurus-preset-classic`, you can skip
this step. You don't need to install as a standalone dependency because the
styles are already included in the preset.
:::

:::tip
The preset is recommended over installing the standalone dependency.
:::

```bash npm2yarn
$ npm install --save @docupotamus/docusaurus-styles-classic
```

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@docupotamus/docusaurus-preset-classic',
      {
        theme: {
          // highlight-next-line
          customCss: require.resolve('@docupotamus/docusaurus-styles-classic'),
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```
