# Stability Promise

- We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our packages.

- However, we're at the early stage where there is a **very rapid development
  cycle**. New code is pushed out in large quantities and very rapidly.

- There _may_ be breaking changes during this early stage, but we're committed
  (1) to minimizing user impact and (2) honing in on **stable releases**.

- If you have comments, questions, or are looking to contribute, please start a
  conversation over a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docupotamus/docupotamus/issues)!
