A Docusaurus theme with a lightweight, unified interface for developing add-ons.

## Try It Out

### Common Use Cases

Use this when you want to enhance your site with powerful **add-ons**.

You can integrate custom React components through a lightweight, unified interface. They are then always readily accessible to developers through the workbench.

For example, integrating with the workbench is how [theme-task-list](./theme-task-list.md) works.

## Installation

:::tip
If you use the preset `@docupotamus/docusaurus-preset-classic`, you don't need
to install this as a dependency because it is already included.
:::

```bash npm2yarn
$ npm install --save @docupotamus/docusaurus-theme-common
```
