# üì¶ theme-zen

import ApiTable from '@site/src/components/ApiTable';

A Docusaurus theme to quiet the distractions and bring the zen.

## Try It Out

While holding down the <kbd>shift</kbd> key, slowly move your mouse around the
main content.

<!-- _keywords:_ demo -->

### Common Use Cases

Use this when you have particularly text-dense content.

Common examples include explanations of complex, technical concepts. The focus
helps make content more approachable and easier to follow.

## Installation

:::tip
If you use the preset `@docupotamus/docusaurus-preset-classic`, you can skip
this step. You don't need to install as a standalone dependency because the
theme is already included in the preset.
:::

:::tip
The preset is recommended over installing the standalone dependency.
:::

```shell npm2yarn
$ npm install --save @docupotamus/docusaurus-theme-zen
```

Then register it in your site's `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  themes: ['@docupotamus/docusaurus-theme-zen'],
};
```
